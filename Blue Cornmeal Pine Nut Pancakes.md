# Blue Cornmeal Pine Nut Panckes

Combine in a large mixing bowl:
* 1c blue cornmeal
* 1c spelt or whole wheat flour
* 1/2t kosher salt
* 1T white sugar
* 3t baking powder
* pinch freshly ground cinammon
* pinch freshly grated nutmeg

Mix dry ingredients together first, then quickly mix in the wet ingredients with just a few strokes. Lumps are good. We like lumps. DO NOT OVER MIX.
* 1 1/2c milk or buttermilk (more as necessary)
* 2 beaten eggs

Gently fold in:
* 1 stick melted butter
* 1/4c dry roasted pine nuts

Cook on unbuttered hot griddle. Flip only once. RESIST the urge to flatten with a spatula. Serve with fresh fruit.
