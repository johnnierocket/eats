# Fresh Egg Noodles

1/2c semolina  
1/2c unbleached wheat flour  
1t salt  
1 egg  
water as necessary  

---

Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and bring together to make a hard ball of pasta. Add moisture as necessary to bring all the flour together, but not too much.  

Knead until smooth (5-10 minutes). Wrap in plastic and let rest 15 minutes. Cut the ball into 6 sections, using a pasta crank to roll out each section into a flat sheet from which you cut 1-inch wide noodles. Apply flour as necessary when cranking to prevent sticking.  

Bring soup to a rolling boil and add noodles, cooking for 10 minutes.
