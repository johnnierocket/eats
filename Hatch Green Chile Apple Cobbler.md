Roast the chiles under the broiler until blackened, about 5 minutes per side. Place chiles in a paper sack or plastic food-storage bag, close tightly, and let them steam for 20 minutes. Take the chiles out of the bag and rub off the skin. Remove seeds and stems, and dice. DO NOT use running water to clean the chiles.

Toss the diced chiles with the diced apples, cinammon, allspice, nutmeg, and brown sugar.

Preheat the oven to 350. To make the crust, in a large cast-iron skillet, melt the butter on low heat. Once melted, turn off the heat. Stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and milk until a batter is formed. Pour the batter over the butter and DO NOT STIR. Spread diced chiles and apples mixture evenly on top of the batter. Again, DO NOT STIR.

Bake uncovered for 45 minutes or until brown and bubbline.

Note: If Hatch chiles aren't in season, you may substitute poblano. That said, if Hatch chiles aren't in season, then neither are granny smith apples, and you shouldn't be cooking this.
