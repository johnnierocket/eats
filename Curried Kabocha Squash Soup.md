Coarsely chop sweet onion and saute in olive oil until slowly until caramelized, allow to cool. Add to food processor with half a cup of chicken stock and puree.

Add the onion/stock puree to a large stock pot, and continue by pureeing each cup of squash with about 3/4 cup of stock, adding to the stock pot.

Add the bay leafs, thyme, and curry powder and simmer, covered, at low-medium heat for an hour. Do not let boil-bubble excessively. Salt and whie pepper to taste.

Remove bay leafs and thyme.

Just before serving, raise the heat to medium and add in one cup of heavy cream. Bring to a near boil.

Serve immediately with a dollop of creme fraiche (or sour cream if you must), toasted pepitas, and a bit of something green (chervil if you can get it. parsley or chives are fine)

* Any fresh organic winter squash can be prepared by taking the whole squash and piercing 3 or 4 slits on the top with a thin sharp knife (penetrating all the way to the hollow), and then setting it on a cookie sheet to bake at 325F for 1.5 hours or until the knife enters the flesh easily. Of course if you want to save the seeds, you cut the squash in half, harvest the seeds, then bake exposed-flesh down in 1/2 inch of water as above. Once cool, the squash meat can be scooped out and used or frozen until use.
