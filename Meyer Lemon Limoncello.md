# Meyer Lemon Limoncello

* 8-10 ripe organic Meyer lemons (you don't want the surface pesticides. Organic please)
* 2 more lemons
* 1 fifth (750ml) of 198proof Everclear
* 4c cane sugar
* 4c water

Extracting the lemon flavor:
* Using a microplane, grate the entire outer layer of the 8-10 Meyer lemons, being careful not to descend into the bitter pith layer.
* Combine the lemon gratings with the bottle of Everclear in a liter jar, and store in a cool, DARK place for 3-4 days.
* Stir once daily.

Preparing the simple syrup:
* Take the remaining 2 lemons and slice them thinly, removing seeds as you slice.
* Combine 4 cups water with 4 cups of cane sugar.
* Add the lemon slices and place on the stove.
* Bring to a boil at medium heat, then reduce to a simmer for 20-30 minutes.
* Remove the candied lemon peel and store for future use (salads, desserts, ice cream, etc.)
* Let the syrup cool down, and store until the extraction process is done.

Making the limoncello:
* One the 4th day, strain the limoncello concentrate through a mesh strainer, being sure to press all the remaining juice from the lemon gratings.
* Measure the quantity of liquid and put in an empty gallon jar.
* Measure out exactly the same amount of simple syrup and add that to the jar.
* Stir well and let sit for 1 hour.
* Stir again and put into smaller containers for storing in the freezer, taking to dinner parties, or gifting to friends.
