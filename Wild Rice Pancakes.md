# Wild Rice Pancakes

* 1/2c uncooked wild rice  
Prepare the night before, as it takes a couple hours of simmering to fully cook, puff up. Place rice in 2c of water and simmer slowly for 1 hour. Cover overnight to let it puff up. Drain excess water before using.

Mix dry ingredients together in a large bowl:
* 1c unbleached white flour, or spelt flour
* 1c whole wheat pastry flour
* 1/2t salt
* 1T white sugar
* hint of cinammon

Mix wet ingredients together, then add to dry ingredients:
* 2 eggs beaten
* 1 1/2c buttermilk, or milk soured with 1t lemon juice

Mix dry and wet ingredients quickly with just a few quick strokes. DO NOT OVER MIX. Lumps are good. We like lumps.

Very gently fold in 1 stick of melted butter, and the cooked wild rice.

Cook on a hot griddle. Flip only once. RESIST flattening with spatula. Serve with fruit preserves, whatever is in season.
