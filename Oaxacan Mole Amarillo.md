Place the chicken, celery, carrot, onion, garlic, bay leaves, and salt to taste in a stockpot with 4 quarts of water. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer until the chicken is tender. Let the chicken cool in the broth, strain the broth, and set aside.

Toast the chiles just until the point of fragrance, taking care not to burn them. Cover them with 1 1/2c of hot broth and cover. let sit 20 minutes. Puree the chiles and their soaking liquid, passing the puree through a food mill. Set aside.

Boil the tomatoes and tomatillos in 1c chicken stock until tomatillos soften. Place the tomatoes, tomatillos, broth, onion, and garlic in a food processor and puree. Pass through a food mill and set aside.

Toast the cloves, allspice, peppercorn, and cumin seeds lightly on a comal or dry griddle, and grind in a spice mill.

Heat the lard or corn oil in a heavy stock pot or cazuela, add the chile puree and fry for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the tomato mixture and the ground spices, stir to blend well and continue cooking for another 5 minutes.

Blend the masa with 1 cup of the broth and add to the mole. Cook, stirring constantly, for 15 minutes. Add 2 1/2c stock to thin the mole to the consistency of heavy cream. Add the whole hoja santa leaves to the mole. 

Serve the mole in bowls, with sauce generously ladled over the pieces of chicken. Accompany with warm tortillas. Serves 6.

Note: If fresh hoja santa (piper auritum) is not available (trust me, it's not unless you're growing it), lightly toasted and finely ground avocado leaves may be substituted. When preparing the mole with beef, Oaxacan cooks add fresh pitonia (lippia alba) instead of hoja santa. The whole can be ommitted entirely.
