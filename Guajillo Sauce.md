Place chiles in stock pot of cold water and bring to a boil. Turn off stove and let sit, covered, for 15 minutes. Discard chile water.  

Dry roast (no oil) garlic cloves and onion quarters in cast iron skillet until browned and softened. Peel garlic. Combine chiles, onion, garlic, and 1-2c good chicken stock in a food processor and puree completely.  

Combine olive oil, cumin, coriander, and oregano into cast iron skillet or thick-bottom saute pan. Slowly heat and toast the spices. Add pureed chiles (in batches if necessary to avoid splattering). Add any remaining stock.  

Cook for 30 minutes, uncovered, stirring continuously until sauce thickens. Salt to taste.  

Pass through large mesh sieve to remove particulate.
