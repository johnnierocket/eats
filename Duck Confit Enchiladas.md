### Serves 4 as a main course or 12 as a starter

* 4 raw leg-thigh quarters or 3 duck breasts (with skin)  
* 3c duck fat
* For marinade/brine:
  * 2T kosher salt
  * 1T freshly ground black pepper

Combine marinade ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add the duck and stir until completely covered. Remove to ziplock bag and refrigerate for 24-48 hours.

Remove from fridge and scrape off all marinade particulates. Avoid using running water to rinse off particulates. Hand scrape.

Melt the duck fat in a deep dish (for which you have a lid) in the oven at 140F. When completely melted, place the duck (skin-side up) in the fat making sure they don't overlap too much. Add olive oil if necessary to make sure the duck is completely submerged in fat.

Cover and return to the oven and cook at 140F overnight for 6-8 hours.

Remove from head, pull the duck out of the oil, and allow to cool before removing meat from the bone. Chop coarsely.

Enchilada Preparation:
* 2 baking pans (13x9x2)
* olive oil as necesary
* 36 corn tortillas 3.5" diameter (commercial corn tortillas trimmed with a cookie cutter)
* 1 cup vegetable oil

Into each of the baking pans, add 1/2c Chimayo red chile sauce and 1/4c olive oil. Preheat oven to 350F.

Head the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot, fry the tortilla rounds, 2 at a time, for no more than a few seconds (pliable is the goal). Remove, drain, and place flat in the baking pan as a 2-tortilla stack. Continue until there are 6 stacks of 2 tortillas each uniformly spaced in each of the baking pans. (Remove oil from heat).

Take a mixture of duck confit, goat cheese, and shallots, and place equal spoonfulls on each of the tortilla stacks.

Fry another dozen tortillas in the oil and place one on top of each duck/tortilla stack.

Smother, gently, with more Chimayo sauce such that each stack is coated. Reserve some sauce for finishing and serving.

Cover the pans with foil and bake 45 minutes at 350F. Rest for 10 minutes before serving.

Serving:

Ladle 2-3 ounces of Chimayo sauce onto the bottoms of 4 serving plates. Place 2-3 enchilada stacks on each of the plates and drizzle them with the smallest amount of creme fraiche or Mexican crema fresca, then garnish with chiffonade of fresh basil (do not substitute cilantro). As side dishes, add saffron jasmine rice and blanched asparagus. Goes well with a peppery Syrah.

Notes:

Ideally the tortillas will be homemade from Sunny State (of San Jon, NM) Organic Blue Corn that has been home nixtamalized to make fresh corn masa.
