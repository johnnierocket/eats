# Absinthe Risotto

* 1c arborio rice
* 3-4c good chicken stock, warmed
* 3 medium shallots, coarsely chopped
* 1/2c reggiano parmesan cheese, grated
* 1/4c good absinthe (not the weirdly colored stuff) or Pernod or Anisette
* olive oil

In a wide saute pan, sweat the chopped shallots with olive oil over medium heat until translucent. Add the rice and stir briefly.

Add 1 cup of stock and begin the process with continuous stirring. Continue to add stock in 1/4c increments as the rice begins to absorb it, stirring continuously.

When the rice is al dente, add the Reggiano, Absinthe, and a bit of stock if necessary. Stir well, cover, turn off the heat and rest for 20 minutes.

Serve with shellfish or white fish (scallops or gulf shrimp are preferred, dusting with chimayo chile dust and searing on a hot griddle). Garnish with a four-leaf tip of french tarragon.
