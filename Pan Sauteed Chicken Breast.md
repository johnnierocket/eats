Sauteeing:

pour about 1/4" of basil-infused olive oil in a frying skillet (if you don't have Johnnie's basil oil, pour olive oil in a skillet and sautee fresh basil for 1 minute and then remove)

Make sure the oil is hot, then add filets and sautee on one side, gently agitating the skillet, but not touching the filets until you are ready to flip them.

Flip them only once if you can negotiate that trick, then reduce the heat to make sure they are cooked through.
