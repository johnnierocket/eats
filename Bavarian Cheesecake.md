# Bavarian Cheesecake
### from Joe Arredondo
"Obtained in 1973 from one of my Swiss travelling companions."

* 1 1/2# cream cheese (if you must, Philadelphia is ok. Attempt to find something local, or at least higher quality.)
* 1c white sugar
* 3 egg whites + 1 whole egg (disposing of 3 of the yolks makes for a lighter, creamier cheesecake)
* 1T lemon juice
* 1t lemon zest
* 1/2t vanilla extract (again, vanillin if you must. But if you have access to REAL vanilla extract, use. it.)

Beat cream cheese and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

Blend in lemon juice, zest, and vanilla. Pour the mixture into a CHILLED crust.

Bake at 375F for 45 minutes, using a knife test for doneness. Cool for 30 minutes.

Topping
* 2 cups creme fraiche (sour cream is just fine, a massive batch of creme fraiche isn't worth the heachace here)
* 3T white sugar
* 1/2 vanilla bean scrapings

Blend together and spread over cooled cheesecake. Bake at 500F for 10 minutes.

Cool for 30 minutes, then refrigerate overnight. Serves 12-16.
