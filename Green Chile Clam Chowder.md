Dice potatoes and carrots, set aside in cold water. Dice celery and onions, and saute them in olive oil until translucent. Set aside.  

In 8-quart stock pot, cook bacon in the butter until crisp, add white flour to build a roux. Slowly whisk in chicken stock. Then add clam juice and liquid from cans.  

Drain water and add diced potatoes and carrots. Add celery, onions, garlic, clams, green chiles, ground pepper.  

Simmer, stirring occasionally for 45 minutes. Chowder should be slightly viscous, but not thick and gummy.  

5 minutes before serving, add bay scallops. Cook for 5 minutes. Add heavy cream and bring back up to a low boil.  

Salt to taste, carefully.  

Serve with hot, crusty ciabatta.
