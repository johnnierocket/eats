# Stewed Longneck Calabasa

* 2-3# chicken breast

* 1/4c olive oil

In a very large (8qt or larger) stew pot for which you have a lid, combine the following ingredients and stew/brown until the meat is mostly done.
* chicken breast, cut into dice-sized cubes
* coriander
* cumin
* garlic cloves, pressed
* 1/4c olive oil

While the meat is searing, use a potato peeler to remove the skin of the calabasa, peeling off the top skin and the green layer below it to reveal the cream-colored layer of the squash. Cut into cubes about 1", removing and discarding all seeds and pith. Add all of the squash to the meat and stir completely, then cover and cook at medium-low heat, with a heat dissipater under the stewpot to prevent burning on the flame - especially if the stewpot is not heavy gauge. Stir every 20 minutes for 1 hour or until the squash begins to look done and starts falling apart.

Add the corn and chopped green chiles, stir completely, and cook, covered, for another 20 minutes.

Serve with black beans, avocado, cilantro, and flour tortillas. Makes ~2 quarts.
