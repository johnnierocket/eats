# Johnnie's Pizza Sauce

* 28oz San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes ("San Marzano" meaning the tomatoes are imported from that region of Italy. In the US, the term "San Marzano" is a marketing term and is not enforced. Look at the can of tomatoes you pick off the shelf to see if they are imported. They will be expensive. Expect to pay $5-7 a can).
* 4 cloves garlic, pressed or finely minced
* 1/4c olive oil
* kosher salt to taste
* optional: half a small can of organic tomato paste (this will make the sauce much richer. If you're wanting a true neopolitan style light sauce, omit)

This is a raw sauce. Please do not cook it. You'll ruin the delicate flavors of the expensive tomatoes you purchased, and you could have just bought the 99-cent can. The sauce will cook in the oven.

Squeeze the tomatoes by hand and crush them through your fingers. Continue until they are the consistency you prefer. You may stop at rustic, and you may continue until it's almost a puree. But please, whatever you do, resist the urge to get out the stick blender. You will whip air into the sauce and oxidize the expensive tomatoes you purchased, destroying much of their aroma.

Add pressed garlic, and drizzle in the olive oil while mixing with a spoon or fork (NOT a whisk. remember, we're not making whipped cream). Taste and add kosher salt until satisfied.

Use immediately or refrigerate for up to a week.

Note: This makes a beautiful pasta sauce as well. If tossing in pasta and you want a little more depth, add dried oregano and red pepper flakes for an arrabiata-style sauce.
