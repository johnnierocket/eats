# Oaxacan Mole Coloradito
### from Joe Arredondo
_Makes about 4 8oz tubs of concentrate_

Chiles: Toast the chiles on a griddle for a bit then grind in a spice mill and place in a large mixing bowl
* 16 chilhaucle mulatos (about 3/4 - 1c of ground powder)
* 16 pasilla de Oaxaca (about 3/4 - 1c of ground powder)
* 8 dried anchos (about 1 cup of ground powder) OR 3/4 ancho and 1/4c Chimayo powder
* 2 dried chipotles (optional for greater piquancy)

Nuts: In Oaxaca they start with whole nuts and run them all through a giant mill along with the chiles, piloncillo, cinnamon, and chocolate. In the absense of a giant mill, I tend to buy fresh ground roasted seeds. Pumpkin seeds, pine nuts, and pecans I typically roast myself before grinding up.
* 1/2c roasted peanut butter
* 1/2c roasted almond butter
* 1/2c roasted cashew butter
* 1/2c roasted sesame tahini
* 1/2c roasted pecans, finely ground
* 1/2c pepitas (pumpkin seeds), roasted and finely ground
* 1 1/2" of cinnamon stick - only the flaky Mexican variety - finely ground.
* 100g 100% pure cacao - Claudio Corallo is the best for this in the absense of actual cocoa beans (hand roasted and ground).
* 1c piloncillo or panela or jaggery (or store-bought brown sugar) finely ground and packed
* Toasted _pan de muerto_ or other toasted, dry, hard bread (equal to one dinner roll); ground up.

Misc spices/herbs (all freshly ground):
* 1/4t ground anise
* 1/4t ground clove
* 1/4t ground allspice
* 1/4t ground cumin
* 1/4t ground black peppercorn
* 1/4t ground dried Mexican oregano

Dried fruits - use an assortment:
* 6 dried cranberries
* 6 dried raisins
* 6 dried tart cherries
* 3 dates chopped

Vegetable oil as necessary.

Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl, then work 2-3 cups at a time in a food processor until a thick paste forms. Combine all batches together to assure a uniform flavor.

Store in 8oz tubs (in freezer).

To make the sauce, combine the contents of one tub with 3 cups of _good chicken stock_. Simmer at low heat until it thickens. Cover for an hour or simmering. Add more stock if necessary or reduce until the perfect consistency. Salt to taste. Run through a fine-mesh sieve to remove particulates. Serve with roasted fowl.
