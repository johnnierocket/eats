# Pan Fried Meatloaf
## after Three Little Pigs, Austin

Mirepoix:  
1c sweet onion, 1/4" dice  
1c celery, 1/4" dice  
1c grated orange carrot  
3 cloves garlic, minced  

For the meatloaf:  
1# ground chuck (80/20)  
1# ground pork (not lean)  
1T dried herbes de provence  
1T kosher salt  
1T freshly ground black peppercorn  
1 egg  
10 crumbled club crackers  
2T milk  

Other:  
1T olive oil

For the gravy:  
4T pan drippings from cooked meatloaf  
4T unbleached white flour  
2-4c beef stock (don't cheap out here. get the good stuff)

Mashed potatoes: (scale to whatever size batch you want to make, this will feed 4 as a main course, 8 as a tapa)  
8 medium yukon gold potatoes (~3" diameter)  
4T unsalted irish butter  
1/2c creme fraiche (or sour cream, or milk if unavailable)  
1/4c fresh chives (do not use dry. omit if unavailable)

In a saute pan over medium heat, sweat onion, celery, and carrot until soft. For a darker flavor, slowly caramelize. Add pressed garlic 1 minute before removing from heat. When done, place in a bowl in the freezer to cool 15 minutes.

In a stock pot, cover potatoes with cold water and bring to a boil for 15 minutes, testing for doneness. Mash by hand or use a ricer, add butter, creme, minced chives, and salt to taste.

Preheat oven to 350F.

Add "for the meatloaf" ingredients and the cooled down mirepoix in a mixing bowl and mix by hand until JUST combined, 1 minute. Your hands will warm the meat and begin to liquify the fat content, causing a tough meatloaf. DO NOT OVERMIX.

Form the meatloaf into a log roughly 4-5" in diameter and 12" long, and nestle into a deep walled, 2qt cassrole dish with 1T olive oil on the bottom.

Bake uncovered, without convection, 40 minutes. Raise oven to 400F and bake an additional 15 minutes. Interior temp should be 155. Remove from the oven and reserve 4T accumulated juices for the gravy. Refrigerate the remaining liquid as a soup starter, or discard.

Baste the top of the meatloaf lightly with ketchup. Broil 5 min (or until ketchup begins to caramelize). Allow meatloaf to rest 20 minutes before cutting.

For the gravy, heat the reserved drippings in a sauce pan and add the flour, whisking constantly for 2 min until the roux becomes a light golden brown. Add 1c of the beef stock, whisking constantly. When smooth, add the remaining stock and bring to a simmer. Taste to season, it will need salt, pepper, and likely a dash of sugar.

To finish, pan fry 1-2 inch slices of meatloaf with a few drops of olive oil in a searing hot, nonstick saute pan.

Serve over mashed potatoes, top with gravy, and garnish with chiffonade of fresh basil.

Excellent with grilled caesar salad and a light red, Syrah preferred.
