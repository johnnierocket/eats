# Johnnie's Pizza Dough

* 520g unbleached high-gluten flour (preferrably Caputo 00, but store-bought bread flour works in a pinch)
* 330g warm water (110F)
* 10g kosher salt
* 8g dry active yeast (NOT instant rise) (or if you have it, 1/2c sourdough starter at room temp)
* optional: dried oregano

Combine all ingredients, dry first then water, in a mixing bowl (or Kitchenaid bowl) and knead. 10 minutes if by hand on a floured surface, 5 minutes with a dough hook in the Kitchenaid. Moisture content should be as wet as possible without sticking to your fingers. ~65% moisture; almost but not tacky. If kneading by hand, the flour on your work surface should suffice to bring the dough to the correct moisture level. If using a Kitchenaid, you may have to add a couple extra grams of flour at a time during the process. Be cognizant that flour takes up to 20 minutes to fully saturate with water. Don't overdo it. If unsure, too wet is infinitely better than too dry.

Form the dough ball with a taught outer skin and set in a turned-off oven with the light on, in a container coated with olive oil, covered, for 1.5 hours.

Separate the dough into 4 ~215g balls and reform. If using immediately, dust with flour until use.

Preference (especially if using sourdough starter) is to transfer the dough balls individually into quart ziplock bags and refrigerate for 24-48 hours, allowing a slow fermentation.

To use, bring dough to room temperature, and hand-pull into a pizza dough. The dough should not spring back to the point that it is difficult to work with; it should have no memory. If it is too elastic, it is either not warm enough, or needs to rest longer for more gluten to develop.

Makes 4 12" pies. This batch size is chozen in part because the dough will keep in the fridge for up to 4 days. In addition, this is really the largest amount of dough you want to mix in a normal size Kitchenaid in order to not stress the motor.

The recipe above produces a predictable neopolitan-style dough. For a more artisan dough, replace the single type of flour with:

* 175g whole spelt flour
* 175g whole wheat pastry flour
* 175g hard wheat unbleached white flour (Caputo 00 is preferred)
