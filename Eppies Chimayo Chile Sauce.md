In a 5-6 quart saute skillet (with lid), combine fat and flour over medium heat to make a roux. Add freshly ground cumin, coriander, oregano, and garlic. Cook for 1 minute. Add the chile powder and stir for another minute to toast. DO NOT BURN!

Add the chicken stock and French tarragon and stir.

Cover and let thicken on low heat, stirring regularly. After 30 minutes, taste and adjust salt content. Cook 15 minutes more, and remove from heat.

Run the sauce through a medium sieve (mesh ~1/16") to remove all the bitter and large particulates. Use immediately or store in fridge for up to 3 days.
