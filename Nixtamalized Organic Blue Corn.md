# Nixtamalized Organic Blue Corn

* 2-3 quarts whole organic blue corn
* 1/4c anhydrous lime powder

In a stainless steel 10-12 quart stock pot, place the whole blue corn. Add water to fill the pot and bring to a boil. As it reaches a boil, add the anhydrous lime, stir completely, and turn heat off.

Let sit overnight.

The next day, drain and rinse removing sloughed off pericarp of the kernels.  Do this 20 times or until sufficiently rinsed. Cover the kernels with cold water and let sit overnight before draining. Now DO THAT AGAIN. My grandmother used to soak the nixtamalized corn for nearly a week to remove all vestiges of lime from the hominy or posole.
